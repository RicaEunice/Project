# Project
Ever since I was young I like to eat most especially dessert. When I was younger, I am tasked to make the usual desserts during celebrations. 
That is why as a person who likes to eat at the same time cook and bake, I created a simple program which allows users to save a recipe. I made
a program that lets the user create his or her own recipe book. In the recipe book program, you can add your own recipe and view them just like a recipe book.

While making this program, I practiced some best practices. I have less than 2000 lines of code and the file has documentation comments through the use of JavaDoc. 
I practiced camel case when naming a class, method, or variable. Methods used verbs such as create, view, and add. I also spaced my lines for easier viewing.

I also made use of 3 design patters. One for each category. For the creational pattern, I used Singleton Pattern. It can be seen in the Main Class. 
It has one instance that is reused again and again. For the Structural Pattern, I made used of Adapter Pattern. I used this pattern so that the details 
of the recipe will be allowed to be reused. Lastly, I used Iterator Pattern for the Behavioral Pattern. I used this pattern so that the courses will be enumerated.
